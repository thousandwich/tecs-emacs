emacs major modes for languages from tecs
* asm
* vm
* jack

the goal is to get something with 
* syntax-highlighting (including keywords)
* proper indentation

we could also do a mode for the .hack files that would be a
disassembler, split window vertically and display the lines as D=C;J
on the other side (and scroll/highlight both buffers when either moves).
